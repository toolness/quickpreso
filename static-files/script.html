When Atul first started knitting, everything looked like gobbledygook.

Over time he learned how threads wove into a fabric.

A teacher showed him how to hack and debug his knits with a crochet hook if he missed a stitch.

And he was able to start crafting his own things.

Knitting is a bit like coding.
